# Github Profile Views Spammer

### The most simple way to spam and increase your github profile views, I used it only once so yes my views are'nt fake only 100 of them hahahah


### Step 1: Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/py-shit/github-views-spammer.git
```

### Step 2: Open the repository in your favorite IDE
```bash 
    cd py-shit/github-views-spammer
    code .
```

### Step 3: Change to your URL (-:
```py
    url = "your-url" # getting your url by clicking on the little views button on your readme page, and copying the url of the page you got redirected to, simple as that...
    ```

### Step 4: Run the Program
```bash 
    python3 ./github-views-spammer
    python ./github-views-spammer
```
Or just lower your ego and run this from Pycharm / Vscode.
Have a nice day!
